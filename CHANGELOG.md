# Changelog

All notable changes to mfo are recorded here. Landed **batches** (from [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)) are
moved here when complete, with the spec IDs they satisfied.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project aims
to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it reaches `0.1.0`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Batch 0.4 — CLI skeleton & config** (M0 Foundation):
  - `mfo.cli`: a Typer app (`mfo`) with `init`, `status`, `run`, `export`, `review` commands and
    a `--version`/`--log-level` callback. `init` creates a project (name defaults to the
    directory) and refuses to overwrite an existing one; `status` reports per-stage progress
    (import/detect/ocr/translate/render) inferred from stored data. `run`/`export`/`review`
    open the project and print a placeholder until their milestones land.
  - Layered config (`Settings`, `build_settings`): built-in defaults < TOML config file
    (top-level or `[mfo]` table) < CLI options; unknown keys rejected (FR-47, NFR-12).
  - Idempotent structured logging to stderr (`configure_logging`, `get_logger`).
  - Tests: Typer `CliRunner` coverage of version/help, init (incl. config-file defaults and
    CLI override), status stage reporting, missing-project errors, and the run stub. Adds
    `typer` dependency.
  - Satisfies: FR-46, FR-47, NFR-12; groundwork for FR-45.
- **Batch 0.3 — Persistence layer** (M0 Foundation):
  - `mfo.storage`: project directory layout (`ProjectLayout`, spec §15), human-readable
    `manifest.json` reader/writer (`Manifest`), and a `ProjectStore` facade for
    create/open/save that refuses to overwrite an existing project (I-1).
  - SQLite store (`Database`) with `PRAGMA user_version` migrations and typed, generic entity
    CRUD (`save`/`save_all`/`get`/`list`); each entity is stored as a JSON blob plus indexed
    columns, with `where`/`order_by` validated against known columns to stay injection-safe.
  - Crash-safe `atomic_write_bytes`/`atomic_write_text` (temp + fsync + `os.replace`) and a
    content-addressed `Cache` with SHA-256 hashing helpers (`content_key`, `sha256_file`).
  - Moved the canonical `id` field onto the `MfoModel` base.
  - Tests: atomic-write crash safety, cache round-trip, DB migration/idempotent-reopen,
    entity CRUD round-trip, and ProjectStore create/open/persist.
  - Satisfies: I-1, I-5, FR-4, FR-48, NFR-10, NFR-11, NFR-26, NFR-27; spec §11.2, §15.
- **Batch 0.2 — Core data model** (M0 Foundation):
  - `mfo.core` entities (Pydantic v2): `Project, Page, Region, OCRSpan, TranslationCandidate,
    TranslationUnit, EditRecord, RenderArtifact`, plus geometry primitives (`BBox`, `Point`) and
    enums (region type/status, reading direction, translation style, candidate kind, edit action).
    Models forbid unknown fields and round-trip losslessly to/from JSON.
  - Dependency-free ULID identifier scheme (`mfo.core.ids`) with self-describing per-entity
    prefixes (e.g. `rgn_…`, `tu_…`) that are unique and time-sortable.
  - Integrity check: a `TranslationUnit`'s `selected_candidate_id` must reference one of its
    candidates.
  - Tests: ID format/uniqueness/sortability and Hypothesis property-based lossless round-trip
    for models. Adds `pydantic` (runtime) and `hypothesis` (dev) dependencies.
  - Satisfies: I-2, FR-41, NFR-30; spec §11.
- **Batch 0.1 — Repo scaffolding & tooling** (M0 Foundation):
  - `pyproject.toml` with hatchling build backend, src layout, package `mfo`, dev extras
    (pytest/ruff/mypy/pre-commit), and the `mfo` console script.
  - Layered package skeleton `src/mfo/{core,vision,language,render,storage,cli,ui}` per spec §15,
    with a `py.typed` marker and a placeholder CLI entry point (full CLI in batch 0.4).
  - Tooling config: ruff (lint + format), mypy `--strict`, pytest; `.editorconfig`,
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  - GitHub Actions CI running lint, format-check, type-check, and tests on Python 3.11–3.13.
  - `tests/test_smoke.py` verifying the package imports across all layers.
  - Satisfies: NFR-28, NFR-29; spec §15.
- Project documentation set: `README.md`, `PLAN.md` (milestone/batch roadmap), `CLAUDE.md`
  (agent guidance), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and this
  `CHANGELOG.md`. Derived from `mfo_design_notes_spec.md`.

### Notes
